## What is it?

A PHP micro-framework (well, more like a "mini" framework) for creating RESTful API services quickly and efficiently.
Its meant to work as a sort of ["boilerplate"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) for REST-like API services in PHP.

## Getting Started

- PHP 5.4.x is required
- Download the current [stable release](//github.com/Rican7/Paulus/archive/master.zip)
- Setup [URL rewriting](https://gist.github.com/4191715) for the [routing engine (Klein)](https://github.com/chriso/klein.php)
- Configure the framework to your needs <!-- TODO -->
- Create a route (and optionally, a controller) and start hitting your newly created API!
